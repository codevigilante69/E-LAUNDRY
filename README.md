# E-LAUNDRY
The main purpose of this Database software is to automate the Laundry shop, R.S Drycleaners in COS in Thapar University, Patiala. The shop had opened a long time back and till date works on a manual system. The shop maintained no records in form of registers and relied on their memory to know which service was to be done on which clothes. Since they never record anything, there are possibilities of errors. This system is only good for use if less students used it, but with increasing student population in the campus, the need of automation arises since the manual system has drawbacks of its own when services are to be performed in large number. Hence, to serve this purpose, and also taking the opportunity given by our college we are making a DBMS software to automate the shop, thus reducing some amount of workload from the shop workers.
